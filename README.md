I recently built a clone of the official RSMT (Rajarshi School of Management & Technology) website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

Responsive web design

Layout and styling with CSS

Simple JavaScript functionality (carousel, dynamic year, etc.)

This is a student-made demo clone for learning purposes. All images and content are placeholders.

ðŸ’¡ I built this project to improve my frontend development skills and explore building realistic, responsive websites.
